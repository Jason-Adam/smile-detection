# Smile Detection in Real Time Video Feed  
The goal of the project is to build a convolutional neural network (CNN) that can predict if a person is smiling in real-time.  
## Dataset Overview  
The dataset used for this project comes from the following repo ([hromi/SMILEsmileD](https://github.com/hromi/SMILEsmileD)). The SMILE dataset consists of xxxx tightly cropped grey-scale photos.  

The repo can be cloned to your local machine with the following command  
```
git clone https://github.com/hromi/SMILEsmileD.git
```

## Model Architecture  
This project utlizes Tensorflow (specifically Keras) for the construction and training of the CNN. Further model details will be added as the project progresses.
